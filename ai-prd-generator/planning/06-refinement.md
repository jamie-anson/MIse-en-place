# Phase 6: Refinement & Polish

*Vibe: Make it shine!*

**Goal:** Improve the user experience, add loading states, and handle errors.

**Steps:**

1.  **Loading Indicators:**
    *   Ensure the webview's loading spinner is reliable.
    *   Use `vscode.window.withProgress` for a native VS Code progress notification during the API call.

2.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Wrap API calls and file operations in `try/catch` blocks.
    *   Use `vscode.window.showErrorMessage` for critical failures.
    *   Use `vscode.window.showWarningMessage` for non-critical issues.

3.  **UI/UX Polish:**
    *   Use Tailwind CSS to ensure all webviews have a clean, consistent design.
    *   Write clear placeholder text and instructions in the input webview.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   Test with a variety of inputs (long, short, vague, specific).
    *   Simulate API errors and network failures.
    *   Verify all files are created correctly and visualizations are accurate.
