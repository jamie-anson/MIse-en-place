# Context Card for /Users/Jammie/Code/MIse-en-place/ai-prd-generator/src/utils/projectStateDetector.ts

This document provides a high-level overview of the code structure, including key functions and classes, to help developers quickly understand the module's purpose and public API.

## Classes

### `class ProjectStateDetector`

**Summary:** The `ProjectStateDetector` class likely plays a role in monitoring and managing the different states of the project, particularly in relation to how the components (such as the contact form storage and homepage features) interact and function within the broader "Contact Page" module.

**Signature:** `class ProjectStateDetector { ... }`

**Methods:**

- **`detectProjectState`**
  - **Summary:** The `detectProjectState` method is an asynchronous function designed to analyze and determine the current state of the "Contact Page" feature within the project's architecture, potentially aiding in identifying active components, dependencies, and any existing issues related to the module's ongoing functionality.
  - **Signature:** `public static async detectProjectState(): Promise<ProjectState>`

- **`findPRDFiles`**
  - **Summary:** The `findPRDFiles` method asynchronously searches for and returns a list of URIs for all product requirement document (PRD) files within a given workspace directory, integrating with Visual Studio Code APIs to assist developers in efficiently locating relevant documentation files.
  - **Signature:** `private static async findPRDFiles(workspaceUri: vscode.Uri): Promise<vscode.Uri[]>`

- **`findContextCardFiles`**
  - **Summary:** The `findContextCardFiles` method asynchronously retrieves an array of URIs for context card files within a specified workspace, playing a crucial role in locating the necessary resources for the "Contact Page" feature.
  - **Signature:** `private static async findContextCardFiles(workspaceUri: vscode.Uri): Promise<vscode.Uri[]>`

- **`findContextTemplateFiles`**
  - **Summary:** The `findContextTemplateFiles` method asynchronously searches for and retrieves URIs of context template files within a specified workspace directory, aiding the development process by organizing relevant context files for the "Contact Page" feature.
  - **Signature:** `private static async findContextTemplateFiles(workspaceUri: vscode.Uri): Promise<vscode.Uri[]>`

- **`findCCSFiles`**
  - **Summary:** The method `findCCSFiles` asynchronously scans the specified workspace directory for any `.ccs` files and returns their URIs as a Promise, aiding in the identification and processing of contact page styling resources in a development environment.
  - **Signature:** `private static async findCCSFiles(workspaceUri: vscode.Uri): Promise<vscode.Uri[]>`

- **`checkDiagramExists`**
  - **Summary:** The method `checkDiagramExists` asynchronously checks if a specific diagram file, identified by `fileName`, exists within a given workspace, represented by `workspaceUri`, and returns a boolean indicating its presence.
  - **Signature:** `private static async checkDiagramExists(workspaceUri: vscode.Uri, fileName: string): Promise<boolean>`
