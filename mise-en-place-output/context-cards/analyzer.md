# Context Card for /Users/Jammie/Code/MIse-en-place/ai-prd-generator/src/context-card-generator/analyzer.ts

This document provides a high-level overview of the code structure, including key functions and classes, to help developers quickly understand the module's purpose and public API.

## Classes

### `class CodeAnalyzer`

**Summary:** The `CodeAnalyzer` class is likely designed to parse and evaluate code within the "Contact Page" feature, potentially aiding in the validation or optimization of scripts handling form submissions and database interactions to ensure efficiency and compliance with design constraints.

**Signature:** `class CodeAnalyzer { ... }`

**Methods:**

- **`constructor`**
  - **Summary:** The `constructor()` method initializes the `ContactFormHandler` class, setting up necessary state and configurations for processing and storing contact form submissions in the in-memory SQLite database during the server's runtime.
  - **Signature:** `constructor()`

- **`analyze`**
  - **Summary:** The `analyze` method processes a given source code string to generate an `AnalysisResult` that evaluates the data stored in the contact form submissions for the pizza place website, facilitating backend validation and storage interaction using the contact form functionality.
  - **Signature:** `public analyze(sourceCode: string): AnalysisResult`

- **`findFunctions`**
  - **Summary:** The `findFunctions` method identifies and returns a list of functions along with their corresponding syntax nodes within the parsed structure, playing a critical role in analyzing and handling submissions within the "Contact Page" feature.
  - **Signature:** `private findFunctions(node: Parser.SyntaxNode): [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]`

- **`findClasses`**
  - **Summary:** The `findClasses` method identifies and returns a list of classes within a given syntax tree node, pairing each class's information with its corresponding syntax node to facilitate the parsing and subsequent processing of contact form submissions in the "Contact Page" feature.
  - **Signature:** `private findClasses(node: Parser.SyntaxNode): [ClassInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]`

- **`findMethodsInClass`**
  - **Summary:** The `findMethodsInClass` method identifies and retrieves a list of method nodes and their associated information from a given class node within the syntax tree, playing a crucial role in analyzing and processing JavaScript classes as part of the contact page module's backend functionality.
  - **Signature:** `private findMethodsInClass(classNode: Parser.SyntaxNode): [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][] { ... }`

- **`analyzeDependencies`**
  - **Summary:** The `analyzeDependencies` method examines and identifies dependencies between functions and classes in the provided list of syntax nodes, which is crucial for understanding interactions and relationships within the "Contact Page" feature's code structure.
  - **Signature:** `private analyzeDependencies(
    functionsWithNodes: [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][],
    classesWithNodes: [ClassInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]
  ): void { ... }`

- **`getSignature`**
  - **Summary:** The `getSignature` method retrieves a unique string identifier for a syntax node in the context of parsing and storing contact form submissions.
  - **Signature:** `private getSignature(node: Parser.SyntaxNode, bodyFieldName: string): string`

## Functions

### `runTest`

**Summary:** The function `runTest()` initiates automated testing for the contact form submission logic, validating the correctness and reliability of data handling in the in-memory SQLite database setup during server runtime.

**Signature:** `async function runTest()`
