# Context Card for /Users/Jammie/Code/MIse-en-place/ai-prd-generator/src/context-card-generator/analyzer.ts

This document provides a high-level overview of the code structure, including key functions and classes, to help developers quickly understand the module's purpose and public API.

## Classes

### `class CodeAnalyzer`

**Summary:** The `CodeAnalyzer` class is responsible for systematically examining and assessing code quality and structure within the "Review and Rating System" module to ensure adherence to coding standards and optimize performance.

**Signature:** `class CodeAnalyzer { ... }`

**Methods:**

- **`constructor`**
  - **Summary:** The `constructor()` method initializes objects in the "Review and Rating System," setting up necessary parameters and default values to facilitate user reviews and ratings within the Local Home Cooking platform.
  - **Signature:** `constructor()`

- **`analyze`**
  - **Summary:** The `analyze` method processes and evaluates a given string of source code to produce an `AnalysisResult`, serving as a core function within the Review and Rating System for identifying and flagging inappropriate content in user-generated reviews.
  - **Signature:** `public analyze(sourceCode: string): AnalysisResult`

- **`findFunctions`**
  - **Summary:** The `findFunctions` method is a private utility designed to traverse a `Parser.SyntaxNode`, identifying and returning an array of tuples containing `FunctionInfo` objects alongside their corresponding syntax nodes, which can be integral for extracting and organizing function-related data within the broader context of code analysis or manipulation tasks in the Review and Rating System module.
  - **Signature:** `private findFunctions(node: Parser.SyntaxNode): [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]`

- **`findClasses`**
  - **Summary:** The method `findClasses` identifies and returns a list of tuples, each containing class-related information and the corresponding syntax node, playing a crucial role in extracting class structures from the parsed syntax tree within the context of compiling and organizing data, potentially for managing features such as review schemas or menu items in the broader "Review and Rating System."
  - **Signature:** `private findClasses(node: Parser.SyntaxNode): [ClassInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]`

- **`findMethodsInClass`**
  - **Summary:** The `findMethodsInClass` method identifies and returns a list of methods within a given class node in the abstract syntax tree, facilitating the understanding of class structures for backend logic related to the "Review and Rating System."
  - **Signature:** `private findMethodsInClass(classNode: Parser.SyntaxNode): [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][] { ... }`

- **`analyzeDependencies`**
  - **Summary:** The `analyzeDependencies` method examines the relationships between functions and classes represented by syntax nodes to assess and manage dependencies within the Review and Rating System's backend components.
  - **Signature:** `private analyzeDependencies(
    functionsWithNodes: [FunctionInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][],
    classesWithNodes: [ClassInfo, Parser.SyntaxNode][]
  ): void { ... }`

- **`getSignature`**
  - **Summary:** The `getSignature` method constructs a unique signature string for a syntax node and its associated body field name, facilitating the Review and Rating System's process of identifying and managing specific review entries efficiently.
  - **Signature:** `private getSignature(node: Parser.SyntaxNode, bodyFieldName: string): string`

## Functions

### `runTest`

**Summary:** The `runTest` function in the "Review and Rating System" context likely initiates a test suite to verify the functionality and integrity of the review-related logic, ensuring that the processes for submitting, retrieving, and managing reviews operate as intended within the Local Home Cooking platform.

**Signature:** `async function runTest()`
