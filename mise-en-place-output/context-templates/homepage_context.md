# Context: Homepage Feature

## Purpose
The Homepage module serves as the landing page for the pizza place website. Its primary function is to display general information about the pizza place, such as business hours, location, and a brief introduction to the services offered. It provides customers with essential information upon their first visit.

## Key Files

## Related Features

- **Form Handling Module**: Though not directly part of the homepage, it relies on navigation pathways that connect users to the contact form functionality.

## Design Constraints
