# Data Flow Diagram for Local Home Cooking Platform

## Overview
The Local Home Cooking Platform is designed to connect home cooks with local customers seeking authentic meals. The system architecture facilitates profile management, menu setup, secure transactions, and a rating system. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js, interfacing with a MongoDB database to manage user and transaction data, while the frontend employs React for a responsive user interface.

## Data Sources
- **External APIs**: OAuth2 provider for authentication
- **Databases**: MongoDB for storing user profiles, menu items, orders, and reviews
- **User Inputs**: Form submissions for profile management, menu creation, and customer feedback

## Data Processing
- **User Authentication**: Customer and cook login requests are validated against OAuth2.
- **Profile Management**: Profile data is collected or updated through user inputs and stored in the database.
- **Menu Management**: Query and update operations on menu items via structured JSON payloads.
- **Order System**: Transaction processing involving order creation, payment validation, and confirmation.
- **Rating System**: Post-transaction feedback is captured and analyzed for service improvements.

## Data Storage
- **User Profiles**: Stored as collections in MongoDB, preserving details like username, preferences, and cooking specialties.
- **Menu Items**: Menu data including names, descriptions, images, and pricing stored as JSON documents.
- **Orders and Transactions**: Order details and payment statuses are persistently maintained within database collections.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Feedback and ratings managed as part of the user interaction data.

## Data Outputs
- **APIs**: Backend REST API endpoints facilitate operations like user authentication, profile management, and order processing.
- **UI Displays**: Frontend showcases profiles, menus, order histories, and rating data in a user-friendly design.
- **Reports**: Transaction summaries and user activity logs are generated for performance metrics analysis.
