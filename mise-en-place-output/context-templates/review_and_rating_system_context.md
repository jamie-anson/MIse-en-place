# Review and Rating System Context Documentation

## Purpose
The "Review and Rating System" module is designed to facilitate mutual feedback between users of our Local Home Cooking platformâ€”specifically between home cooks and customers. After a transaction is completed, both parties can rate and review each other, which helps maintain transparency, improve service quality, and build trust within the community.

## Key Files
- **RatingController.js**: Handles the business logic for submitting and retrieving reviews.
- **ReviewModel.js**: Defines the data structure and schema for storing reviews in the database.
- **apiRoutes.js**: Contains REST API endpoints for creating and fetching reviews.
- **RatingComponent.jsx**: Frontend component responsible for displaying the rating UI and capturing user input.
- **ReviewListComponent.jsx**: Component to render the list of reviews on a user's profile page.

## Backend
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store review data. Each review document includes fields like user ID, reviewer ID, rating score, comments, and timestamps.
- **APIs**: A RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js facilitates CRUD operations for reviews, ensuring seamless integration between the client-side UI and the database.

## Related Features
- **Cook Profile Management**: Integrates to display cook ratings and reviews.
- **Customer Profile Management**: Allows customers to view their received ratings and reviews.
- **Order and Payment System**: Links with transactions to ensure reviews can only be given following a successful order.

## Design Constraints
- **Rating Scale**: The system uses a 5-star rating scale.
- **Review Moderation**: All reviews should adhere to community guidelines, necessitating backend logic for flagging inappropriate content.
- **Anonymity**: Review anonymity is ensured to protect user identity and promote honest feedback.
- **Frequency**: Users can only rate and review another party once per transaction to prevent spam.

## Open Questions
1. **Review Editing**: Should users be allowed to edit their reviews post-submission, and if so, what constraints should be applied?
2. **Flagging System**: What criteria and processes need to be established for moderating flagged reviews?
3. **Notification Mechanism**: How should users be informed when they receive a new review?
4. **Optimal Load Handling**: Determine the most efficient way to paginate reviews to maintain performance during high access times.
