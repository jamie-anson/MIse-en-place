# Cook Profile Management

## Purpose
The "Cook Profile Management" module is designed to allow cooks on the platform to set up and manage their personal profiles. This includes inputting personal details, cooking specialties, uploading photos, and adding descriptions about their culinary expertise. The purpose is to provide detailed information to potential customers looking for authentic, home-cooked meals from local cooks.

## Key Files

- **cookProfileController.js**: Handles the logic for creating, updating, and retrieving cook profiles.
- **cookProfileRoutes.js**: Defines the API endpoints that interface with the cook profile management functionalities.

## Backend
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store cook profile data, leveraging its NoSQL capabilities for flexible and efficient data handling.
- **API**: REST API built with Node.js and Express.js is employed for communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data operations.

## Related Features

- **Review and Rating System**: Interacts with this module to display and manage reviews and feedback on cook profiles.

## Design Constraints

- **Security**: Use OAuth2 for secure authentication and authorization processes.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the module remains functional and visually appealing across all device types as per the frontend requirements.

## Open Questions
- **Profile Image Size Restrictions**: What should be the maximum allowed dimensions and file size for uploaded images?
- **Optional Fields**: Are there any additional optional fields that should be considered for future implementations, such as social media links or certifications?
- **Localization and Language Support**: How will cooking specialties and descriptions be handled in multiple languages?
