# Menu Creation and Management

## Purpose
The "Menu Creation and Management" module is designed to empower local home cooks by allowing them to create, edit, and manage their menu offerings on the Local Home Cooking Platform. Cooks can add details like names, descriptions, prices, and photos for each menu item, enabling them to showcase their specialties to potential customers. This feature is critical for cooks to attract local customers and manage their culinary offerings efficiently.

## Key Files
- **MenuController.js**: Contains the controller logic for menu creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.
- **menuRoutes.js**: Defines the API routes for menu management functionalities.
- **MenuModel.js**: Represents the MongoDB schema for storing menu items and details.

## Backend
The "Menu Creation and Management" feature primarily relies on:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store dynamic menu data, including item names, descriptions, prices, and associated images.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Serve as the backend framework to handle REST API requests from the frontend and perform CRUD operations on the menu data.

## Related Features
- **Cook Profile Management**: Cooks can create and manage their profiles, which are associated with their menus. A cook's profile displays their specialties alongside the menu items.
- **Order and Payment System**: Integrates with menu items for customers to order and pay for meals directly through the platform.
- **Review and Rating System**: Allows customers to leave feedback on the menu items, impacting menu visibility and cook reputation.

## Design Constraints
- **Responsive Design**: Must ensure the menus can be displayed clearly on various devices, adhering to the broader frontend tech stack of React, HTML, and CSS.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that price inputs are validated and images are properly handled to maintain data quality and prevent inconsistencies.
- **Security**: Integration with OAuth2 for cook authentication and secure SSL data encryption to protect cook-created content.

## Open Questions
- How will updates to menu items affect existing orders? Need discussion on potential impacts and solutions.
- What validation mechanisms will be implemented for cook-uploaded images and descriptions?
