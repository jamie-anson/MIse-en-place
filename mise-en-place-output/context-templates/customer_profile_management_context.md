# Customer Profile Management

## Purpose
The "Customer Profile Management" feature allows customers to create and manage their accounts on the Local Home Cooking Platform. This feature enables customers to easily manage their orders and reviews, ensuring a personalized and convenient user experience.

## Key Files
- **CustomerProfile.js**: Frontend component responsible for rendering the customer profile interface.
- **UserController.js**: Backend controller handling requests and logic related to customer profile management.
- **customerModel.js**: Defines the schema and database interactions for customer profile data in MongoDB.

## Backend
- **Database**: MongoDB is used to store customer-related information, including account details, order history, and reviews.
- **API**: RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js for managing customer profile operations.

## Related Features
- **Order and Payment System**: Integrates with customer profiles to fetch order history and facilitate seamless transactions.
- **Review and Rating System**: Enables customers to view and manage their reviews directly through their profiles.
- **Cook Profile Management**: While distinct, this feature shares some similarities in functionality for managing user information.

## Design Constraints
- **Security**: Must follow best practices for securing user data, including using OAuth2 for authentication and SSL for data encryption.
- **Performance**: Ensure efficient data retrieval to maintain responsive user experience, especially as the database scales.
- **Responsiveness**: Design must be responsive to ensure accessibility across different devices as per frontend requirements.

## Open Questions
- Should customers be able to delete their accounts and, if so, what data should be retained or removed?
- Are there any additional fields or metadata that need to be considered for future enhancements, such as social media integration?
- How should profile data be handled to support any future AI-based recommendation systems?
